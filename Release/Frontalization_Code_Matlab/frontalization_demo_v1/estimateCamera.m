% Used for estimating face pose pose. This is part of the distribution for
% face image frontalization ("frontalization" software), described in [1].
%
% If you find this code useful and use it in your own work, please add
% reference to [1] and [2,3] for the calib function.

%
% Please see demo.m for example usage.
%
% Input: 
%   Model3D: Detector struct with 2D-3D reference correspondences. 
%       This distribution comes with pre-prepared structs for two facial
%       feature detectors. Others can be produced with the function
%       makeNew3DModel.m
%   fidu_XY: Matrix of n x 2 facial feature coordinates obtained with the
%       same detector represented by the Model3D struct.
% Output:
%   projectionMatrix, est_A, est_R, est_T: Estimated projection matrix, 
%       intrinsic matric (est_A), camera rotation matrix (est_R) and
%       translation vector (est_T).
